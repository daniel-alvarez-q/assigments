                    <p>The arepa is a pre-Columbian dish from the area that is now Colombia and Venezuela. 
                        Instruments used to make flour for the arepas, and the clay slabs on which they were cooked, were often found at archaeological sites in the area. 
                        Although it has not been specified in which country an arepa was cooked for the first time, it has been possible to define the oldest dates of the presence of maize in Colombia and in Venezuela. 
                        or example, In Colombia, the first record of the existence of corn dates from about 3,000 years ago, while in Venezuela the estimate is about 2,800 years ago. In other words, the creation of the arepa most likely happened almost simultaneously in both countries, but well before either territory became a country with demarcated borders.
                        Throughout its history, the arepa has stayed mainly unchanged from the arepas that pre-Columbian native peoples would have consumed, making the arepa one of the few pre-contact traditions that have remained popular in the years since colonization.
